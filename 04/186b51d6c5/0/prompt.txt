How can I confirm that the iCloud sync works on my device? When I go to iCloud in the files app, shoud I see "fasola" directory there?

> f you want the directory to appear in Files, change NSUbiquitousContainerIsDocumentScopePublic to true in the config plugin. That exposes the Documents subfolder of the container to the user via Files app.
  Useful for debugging but lets users manually tamper with app data.

Also add the Debug log — the getContainerUrl() call in lib/storage/index.native.ts:41 returns null when iCloud is unavailable. If the app is storing data and photos successfully, the container was resolved. You could
  add a temporary console.log there to confirm the returned URL.
