## Optional: Enhanced Library Documentation Support

Context7 MCP server provides up-to-date library documentation for better spec creation.

Check if Context7 is available: /Users/eryk.napierala/Library/pnpm/context7-mcp

If NOT_INSTALLED and the feature involves external libraries, offer to enable Context7:
```
████ Optional: Enable Context7 for Enhanced Documentation ████

Context7 provides up-to-date library documentation to improve spec quality.
This is optional but recommended when working with external libraries.

Would you like me to install Context7 for you? I can:
  1. Install globally: npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp
  2. Add to Claude Code: claude mcp add context7 context7-mcp

Or you can install it manually later if you prefer.
```

If user agrees to installation:
- Run: `npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp`
- Then run: `claude mcp add context7 context7-mcp`
- Verify installation and proceed with enhanced documentation support

If user declines or wants to continue without it:
- Proceed with spec creation using existing knowledge

## FIRST PRINCIPLES PROBLEM ANALYSIS

Before defining any solution, validate the problem from first principles:

### Core Problem Investigation
- **Strip Away Solution Assumptions**: What is the core problem, completely separate from any proposed solution?
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Why does this problem exist? What created this need?
- **Goal Decomposition**: What are we fundamentally trying to achieve for users/business?
- **Success Definition**: What would success look like if we had unlimited resources and no constraints?
- **Alternative Approaches**: Could we achieve the underlying goal without building anything? Are there simpler approaches?

### Problem Validation Questions
- **Real vs. Perceived**: Is this solving a real problem that users actually have?
- **Assumption Audit**: What assumptions about user needs, technical constraints, or business requirements might be wrong?
- **Value Proposition**: What is the minimum viable solution that delivers core value?
- **Scope Validation**: Are we solving the right problem, or treating symptoms of a deeper issue?

**CRITICAL: Only proceed if the core problem is clearly defined and validated. If uncertain, request additional context.**

## MANDATORY PRE-CREATION VERIFICATION

After validating the problem from first principles, complete these technical checks:

### 1. Context Discovery Phase
- Search existing codebase for similar features/specs using AgentTool
- **Use specialized subagents** when research involves specific domains (TypeScript, React, testing, databases, etc.)
- Run `claudekit list agents` to see available specialized experts
- Match research requirements to expert domains for optimal analysis
- Use general-purpose approach only when no specialized expert fits
- Identify potential conflicts or duplicates
- Verify feature request is technically feasible
- Document any missing prerequisites

### 2. Request Validation
- Confirm request is well-defined and actionable
- If vague or incomplete, STOP and ask clarifying questions
- Validate scope is appropriate (not too broad/narrow)

### 3. Quality Gate
- Only proceed if you have 80%+ confidence in implementation approach
- If uncertain, request additional context before continuing
- Document any assumptions being made

**CRITICAL: If any validation fails, STOP immediately and request clarification.**

## Your task

Create a comprehensive specification document in the `specs/` folder for the following feature/bugfix: 

First, analyze the request to understand:
1. Whether this is a feature or bugfix
2. The scope and complexity
3. Related existing code/features
4. External libraries/frameworks involved

If the feature involves external libraries or frameworks AND Context7 is available:
- Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to find the library
- Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to get up-to-date documentation
- Reference official patterns and best practices from the docs

## END-TO-END INTEGRATION ANALYSIS

Before writing the detailed specification, map the complete system impact:

### System Integration Mapping
- **Data Flow Tracing**: Trace data flow from user action → processing → storage → response
- **Service Dependencies**: Identify all affected services, APIs, databases, and external systems
- **Integration Points**: Map every place this feature touches existing functionality
- **Cross-System Impact**: How does this change affect other teams, services, or user workflows?

### Complete User Journey Analysis
- **Entry Points**: How do users discover and access this feature?
- **Step-by-Step Flow**: What is the complete sequence from start to finish?
- **Error Scenarios**: What happens when things go wrong at each step?
- **Exit Points**: How does this connect to what users do next?

### Deployment and Rollback Considerations
- **Migration Path**: How do we get from current state to new state?
- **Rollback Strategy**: What if we need to undo this feature?
- **Deployment Dependencies**: What must be deployed together vs. independently?
- **Data Migration**: How do we handle existing data during the transition?

**VERIFICATION: Ensure you can trace the complete end-to-end flow before proceeding to detailed specification.**

Then create a spec document that includes:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title of the feature/bugfix
2. **Status**: Draft/Under Review/Approved/Implemented
3. **Authors**: Your name and date
4. **Overview**: Brief description and purpose
5. **Background/Problem Statement**: Why this feature is needed or what problem it solves
6. **Goals**: What we aim to achieve (bullet points)
7. **Non-Goals**: What is explicitly out of scope (bullet points)
8. **Technical Dependencies**:
    - External libraries/frameworks used
    - Version requirements
    - Links to relevant documentation
9. **Detailed Design**:
    - Architecture changes
    - Implementation approach
    - Code structure and file organization
    - API changes (if any)
    - Data model changes (if any)
    - Integration with external libraries (with examples from docs)
10. **User Experience**: How users will interact with this feature
11. **Testing Strategy**:
    - Unit tests
    - Integration tests
    - E2E tests (if needed)
    - Mocking strategies for external dependencies
    - **Test documentation**: Each test should include a purpose comment explaining why it exists and what it validates
    - **Meaningful tests**: Avoid tests that always pass regardless of behavior
    - **Edge case testing**: Include tests that can fail to reveal real issues
12. **Performance Considerations**: Impact on performance and mitigation strategies
13. **Security Considerations**: Security implications and safeguards
14. **Documentation**: What documentation needs to be created/updated
15. **Implementation Phases**:
    - Phase 1: MVP/Core functionality
    - Phase 2: Enhanced features (if applicable)
    - Phase 3: Polish and optimization (if applicable)
16. **Open Questions**: Any unresolved questions or decisions
17. **References**:
    - Links to related issues, PRs, or documentation
    - External library documentation links
    - Relevant design patterns or architectural decisions

Follow these guidelines:
- Use Markdown format similar to existing specs
- Be thorough and technical but also accessible
- Include code examples where helpful (especially from library docs)
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Reference existing project patterns and conventions
- Use diagrams if they would clarify complex flows (using ASCII art or mermaid)
- When referencing external libraries, include version-specific information
- Do NOT include time or effort estimations (no "X days", "Y hours", or complexity estimates)

Name the spec file descriptively based on the feature:
- Features: `feat-{kebab-case-name}.md`
- Bugfixes: `fix-{issue-number}-{brief-description}.md`

## PROGRESSIVE VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS

After completing each major section:

- **Problem Statement**: Verify it's specific and measurable
- **Technical Requirements**: Confirm all dependencies are available
- **Implementation Plan**: Validate approach is technically sound
- **Testing Strategy**: Ensure testability of all requirements

At each checkpoint, if quality is insufficient, revise before proceeding.

## FINAL SPECIFICATION VALIDATION

Before marking complete:
1. **Completeness Check**: All 17 sections meaningfully filled
2. **Consistency Check**: No contradictions between sections  
3. **Implementability Check**: Someone could build this from the spec
4. **Quality Score**: Rate spec 1-10, only accept 8+

Before writing, use AgentTool to search for:
- Related existing features or code
- Similar patterns in the codebase
- Potential conflicts or dependencies
- Current library versions in package.json or equivalent

We want to provide ability to manage recipe sources - rename, remove and add.
That should be a separate screen rendering a list.
Removing should be possible by swiping left (a red thrash icon should appear on the rigth of the list item).
Renaming/editing the title should be possible by swiping right (a blue pencil icon should appear in the left of the list item) - then the item entry should become and inline editable text and the button on the left should become a checkmark button, which when clicked, confirms the edit. Swiping right cancels the edit.
The list should be native Apple iOS app style, such as reminders.
The list should be scrollable. Long labels should be multiline. List items should be separated with a horizontal ruler. Below the book source title, we should display lighter, non-editable (enven in the edit mode) text showing how many recipes belong to the given source.
The screen with the list should be accessible via a button displayed in the top-left corner of the recipes list screen. The button should be three-dots icon that shows a popover with menu (morphing from the button, same as the source selection panel morphs from the plus button). The menu should contain one option - "Manage Books". Later we will add more options.

---

We should change the data model so the source is a proper entity and renaming doesn't require a cascade but a property change on the enitity.

---

I'm answering questions:

1. Delete confirmation - yes please add the extra dialog; include information, that this actions cannot be reversed and it'll remove all imported recipes from that book
2. Orphaned source display - the problem doesn't exist (see above)
3. Source name resolution latency - preload makes sense

# Specification Completeness Check

Analyze the specification at: 

## Analysis Framework

This command will analyze the provided specification document to determine if it contains sufficient detail for successful autonomous implementation, while also identifying overengineering and non-essential complexity that should be removed or deferred.

### Domain Expert Consultation

When analyzing specifications that involve specific technical domains:
- **Use specialized subagents** when analysis involves specific domains (TypeScript, React, testing, databases, etc.)
- Run `claudekit list agents` to see available specialized experts
- Match specification domains to expert knowledge for thorough validation
- Use general-purpose approach only when no specialized expert fits

### What This Check Evaluates:

The analysis evaluates three fundamental aspects, each with specific criteria:

#### 1. **WHY - Intent and Purpose**
- Background/Problem Statement clarity
- Goals and Non-Goals definition
- User value/benefit explanation
- Justification vs alternatives
- Success criteria

#### 2. **WHAT - Scope and Requirements**
- Features and functionality definition
- Expected deliverables
- API contracts and interfaces
- Data models and structures
- Integration requirements:
  - External system interactions?
  - Authentication mechanisms?
  - Communication protocols?
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements

#### 3. **HOW - Implementation Details**
- Architecture and design patterns
- Implementation phases/roadmap
- Technical approach:
  - Core logic and algorithms
  - All functions and methods fully specified?
  - Execution flow clearly defined?
- Error handling:
  - All failure modes identified?
  - Recovery behavior specified?
  - Edge cases documented?
- Platform considerations:
  - Cross-platform compatibility?
  - Platform-specific implementations?
  - Required dependencies per platform?
- Resource management:
  - Performance constraints defined?
  - Resource limits specified?
  - Cleanup procedures documented?
- Testing strategy:
  - Test purpose documentation (each test explains why it exists)
  - Meaningful tests that can fail to reveal real issues
  - Edge case coverage and failure scenarios
  - Follows project testing philosophy: "When tests fail, fix the code, not the test"
- Deployment considerations

### Additional Quality Checks:

**Completeness Assessment**
- Missing critical sections
- Unresolved decisions
- Open questions

**Clarity Assessment**  
- Ambiguous statements
- Assumed knowledge
- Inconsistencies

**Overengineering Assessment**
- Features not aligned with core user needs
- Premature optimizations
- Unnecessary complexity patterns

### Overengineering Detection:

**Core Value Alignment Analysis**
Evaluate whether features directly serve the core user need:
- Does this feature solve a real, immediate problem?
- Is it being used frequently enough to justify complexity?
- Would a simpler solution work for 80% of use cases?

**YAGNI Principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
Be aggressive about cutting features:
- If unsure whether it's needed → Cut it
- If it's for "future flexibility" → Cut it
- If only 20% of users need it → Cut it
- If it adds any complexity → Question it, probably cut it

**Common Overengineering Patterns to Detect:**

1. **Premature Optimization**
   - Caching for rarely accessed data
   - Performance optimizations without benchmarks
   - Complex algorithms for small datasets
   - Micro-optimizations before profiling

2. **Feature Creep**
   - "Nice to have" features (cut them)
   - Edge case handling for unlikely scenarios (cut them)
   - Multiple ways to do the same thing (keep only one)
   - Features that "might be useful someday" (definitely cut)

3. **Over-abstraction**
   - Generic solutions for specific problems
   - Too many configuration options
   - Unnecessary plugin/extension systems
   - Abstract classes with single implementations

4. **Infrastructure Overhead**
   - Complex build pipelines for simple tools
   - Multiple deployment environments for internal tools
   - Extensive monitoring for non-critical features
   - Database clustering for low-traffic applications

5. **Testing Extremism**
   - 100% coverage requirements
   - Testing implementation details
   - Mocking everything
   - Edge case tests for prototype features

**Simplification Recommendations:**
- Identify features to cut from the spec entirely
- Suggest simpler alternatives
- Highlight unnecessary complexity
- Recommend aggressive scope reduction to core essentials

### Output Format:

The analysis will provide:
- **Summary**: Overall readiness assessment (Ready/Not Ready)
- **Critical Gaps**: Must-fix issues blocking implementation
- **Missing Details**: Specific areas needing clarification
- **Risk Areas**: Potential implementation challenges
- **Overengineering Analysis**: 
  - Non-core features that should be removed entirely
  - Complexity that doesn't align with usage patterns
  - Suggested simplifications or complete removal
- **Features to Cut**: Specific items to remove from the spec
- **Essential Scope**: Absolute minimum needed to solve the core problem
- **Recommendations**: Next steps to improve the spec

### Example Overengineering Detection:

When analyzing a specification, the validator might identify patterns like:

**Example 1: Unnecessary Caching**
- Spec includes: "Cache user preferences with Redis"
- Analysis: User preferences accessed once per session
- Recommendation: Use in-memory storage or browser localStorage for MVP

**Example 2: Premature Edge Cases**
- Spec includes: "Handle 10,000+ concurrent connections"
- Analysis: Expected usage is <100 concurrent users
- Recommendation: Cut this entirely - let it fail at scale if needed

**Example 3: Over-abstracted Architecture**
- Spec includes: "Plugin system for custom validators"
- Analysis: Only 3 validators needed, all known upfront
- Recommendation: Implement validators directly, no plugin system needed

**Example 4: Excessive Testing Requirements**
- Spec includes: "100% code coverage with mutation testing"
- Analysis: Tool used occasionally, not mission-critical
- Recommendation: Focus on core functionality tests (70% coverage)

**Example 5: Feature Creep**
- Spec includes: "Support 5 export formats (JSON, CSV, XML, YAML, TOML)"
- Analysis: 95% of users only need JSON
- Recommendation: Cut all formats except JSON - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

This comprehensive analysis helps ensure specifications are implementation-ready while keeping scope focused on core user needs, reducing both ambiguity and unnecessary complexity.

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me go through the conversation chronologically:

1. User invoked `/spec:create` command to create a new specification document
2. I asked what feature/bugfix - user selected "New feature"
3. I asked what feature - user described a "Manage Recipe Sources" feature with:
   - Separate screen with a list of sources
   - Swipe left to delete (red trash icon)
   - Swipe right to edit (blue pencil icon, inline edit with checkmark)
   - Native Apple iOS style like Reminders
   - Scrollable, multiline labels, horizontal separators
   - Recipe count below source title
   - Accessible via three-dots button in top-left of recipes list
   - Three-dots shows popover menu with "Manage Books" option
   - Menu morphs from button like source selector panel

4. I explored the codebase thoroughly using an Explore agent, discovering:
   - Sources are bare strings on RecipeMetadata.source
   - SourceHistoryEntry is {source: string, lastUsedAt: number}
   - No swipeable gestures exist yet
   - react-native-gesture-handler and reanimated are installed
   - Navigation uses expo-router
   - State management is React Context
   - LiquidGlassPopover is the only popover pattern

5. I read multiple files to understand the codebase deeply, then created the initial spec at `specs/016_manage_books/spec.md`

6. User requested: "We should change the data model so the source is a proper entity and renaming doesn't require a cascade but a property change on the entity."

7. I rewrote the spec with:
   - Source entity: {id: SourceId, name: string, lastUsedAt: number}
   - RecipeMetadata.source stores SourceId for books, URL string for web sources
   - SourceRepository replaces SourceHistoryRepository
   - Data migration from bare strings to entity IDs
   - useSourceName hook for resolution

8. User sent corrections while I was working:
   - "The add book button on the bottom should use the new source selector. It should be just a plus button on the bottom right that then triggers the form with checkmark/cancel. We should also display a back button on the bottom left that returns to the recipes list."
   - "the three dots button should be placed on top-right of the recipes list"

9. I updated the spec for both corrections:
   - Three-dots moved to top-right
   - Anchor changed from topLeading to topTrailing
   - Bottom bar: back button (left) + plus button (right)
   - Plus button triggers inline form with checkmark/cancel

10. User said: "Let's not bother with the migration - I'll remove all already added recipes manually. The app isn't used yet in production."

11. I removed all migration-related content from the spec

12. User answered three open questions:
    - Delete confirmation: Yes, add dialog warning it cannot be reversed and will remove all recipes from that book
    - Orphaned source display: Problem doesn't exist (because delete removes recipes too)
    - Source name resolution latency: Preload makes sense

13. I updated the spec for all three decisions:
    - Added confirmation Alert with destructive warning
    - Delete now cascades to remove all recipes
    - SourcesProvider preloads sources at startup
    - useSourceName is synchronous

14. User invoked `/spec:validate` command

15. I performed a thorough validation and found 9 issues:
    1. Duplicate section headers (4 and 5)
    2. Delete cascade not orchestrated (cross-context dependency)
    3. Module boundary violation (lib/hooks importing from features/)
    4. app/recipe/add.tsx direct repository import
    5. SourceSelectorRef.confirmNewSource return type change
    6. Duplicate name prevention missing
    7. i18n plural key format wrong
    8. useSources() hook not defined
    9. getLastUsed sync/async mismatch

16. User said "Please apply suggestions"

17. I started applying fixes:
    - Fix #1: Removed duplicate section header, renumbered 4-7
    - Fix #2: Documented delete cascade orchestration with code showing manage-books screen coordinates across both contexts
    - Fix #3: Moved useSourceName from lib/hooks/ to features/sources/hooks/
    - Fix #4: Added note about direct repository import in app/recipe/add.tsx
    - Fix #5: Documented SourceSelectorRef.confirmNewSource return type change

I had applied fixes 1-5 when the summary was requested. Fixes 6-9 are still pending:
    - Fix #6: Add validation for empty/whitespace names and duplicate names
    - Fix #7: Fix i18n plural keys to use _one/_other
    - Fix #8: Show useSources() hook export explicitly
    - Fix #9: Note getLastUsed is computed synchronously from in-memory array

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user invoked `/spec:create` to create a comprehensive specification for a "Manage Recipe Books" feature. The feature allows users to manage recipe source books (rename, delete, add) from a dedicated screen accessible via a three-dots overflow menu on the recipe list screen. The user iteratively refined the spec through several rounds of feedback:
   - Requested the data model change from bare strings to proper entities with stable IDs
   - Corrected UI placement: three-dots button to top-right, bottom bar with back (left) + plus (right) buttons
   - Removed migration requirement (pre-production app)
   - Answered open questions: add delete confirmation dialog (with recipe deletion warning), preload sources into context
   - Requested validation via `/spec:validate`, then asked to apply the 9 identified fixes

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Source entity model: `{ id: SourceId; name: string; lastUsedAt: number }` replacing bare string sources
   - `RecipeMetadata.source` stores `SourceId` (UUID) for books, URL strings inline for web sources
   - `SourceRepository` replaces `SourceHistoryRepository` with full CRUD
   - `SourcesProvider` preloads all sources into React context for synchronous name resolution
   - `useSourceName` hook for synchronous SourceId → display name resolution
   - Delete cascade orchestrated at the screen level (manage-books screen calls both RecipesContext and SourcesContext)
   - Swipe gestures via `Gesture.Pan` (react-native-gesture-handler) + Reanimated
   - `LiquidGlassPopover` extended with `anchor` prop (`"bottomTrailing"` | `"topTrailing"`)
   - expo-router file-based routing for new `/manage-books` route
   - React 19 `use()` pattern for initial data fetch in providers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `specs/016_manage_books/spec.md` — **The primary deliverable.** Created and iteratively refined through multiple rounds of feedback. Contains the full spec with detailed design, file changes, implementation phases, testing strategy.
   
   - `lib/types/primitives.ts` — Read to understand existing type aliases. Will add `SourceId` type.
     ```typescript
     export type SourceId = string;
     ```
   
   - `lib/types/recipe.ts` — Read to understand current `RecipeMetadata.source` type. Semantics change (SourceId for books, URL for web).
     ```typescript
     export interface RecipeMetadata {
       title?: string;
       source?: SourceId | `https://${string}` | `http://${string}`;
       tags: Array<`#${string}`>;
     }
     ```
   
   - `lib/repositories/sourceHistory.ts` — Read to understand current source storage. To be renamed to `sources.ts` and rewritten as `SourceRepository`.
   
   - `lib/repositories/recipes.ts` — Read to understand recipe storage, `savePending`, `delete` (handles photo/thumbnail cleanup).
   
   - `lib/repositories/types.ts` — Read to understand `RecipeRepository` interface. `savePending` signature changes to accept `SourceId`.
   
   - `features/recipes-list/context/RecipesContext.tsx` — Read to understand provider pattern (React 19 `use()`, `useState`, memoized callbacks). `SourcesProvider` follows same pattern.
   
   - `features/source-selector/components/SourceSelector.tsx` — Read to understand current source picker. Must switch to `Source` entities. `SourceSelectorRef.confirmNewSource` return type changes from `Promise<string | undefined>` to `Promise<SourceId | undefined>`.
   
   - `features/source-selector/hooks/useSourceHistory.ts` — Read. To be deleted, replaced by `SourcesContext`.
   
   - `app/index.tsx` — Read to understand recipe list screen layout. Three-dots button + popover to be added (top-right).
   
   - `app/recipe/add.tsx` — Read. Has direct `sourceHistoryRepository` import that must switch to `useSources().touchSource()`.
   
   - `features/recipe-form/components/AddRecipeForm.tsx` — Read. `source` prop changes from `string` to `SourceId`.
   
   - `features/recipe-form/hooks/useRecipeForm.ts` — Read. `source` field stores `SourceId`.
   
   - `features/recipe-form/components/MetadataFormFields.tsx` — Read. Uses `SourceSelector` with string values, needs entity migration.
   
   - `lib/components/atoms/SourceDisplay.tsx` — Read. Renders `metadata.source` directly, needs `useSourceName` hook.
   
   - `features/recipe-preview/components/MetadataOverlay.tsx` — Read. Renders `metadata.source` directly, needs `useSourceName` hook.
   
   - `modules/liquid-glass/src/LiquidGlassPopover.types.ts` — Read. `anchor` prop to be added.
   
   - `modules/liquid-glass/src/LiquidGlassPopover.ios.tsx` — Read. Passes props to native view.
   
   - `modules/liquid-glass/src/LiquidGlassPopover.tsx` — Read. Non-iOS fallback.
   
   - `specs/015_source_selector_animation/spec.md` — Read for spec format reference and morph animation pattern.
   
   - `AGENTS.md` — Read for code style conventions (explicit return types, `Array<T>` notation, `@/` imports, inline props, no React.FC).
   
   - `platform/i18n/translations/en.json` — Read. New translation keys to be added for menu and manage books.

   - Key new files to be created:
     - `lib/types/source.ts` — Source interface
     - `lib/repositories/sources.ts` — SourceRepository
     - `features/sources/context/SourcesContext.tsx` — SourcesProvider with preloaded context
     - `features/sources/hooks/useSourceName.ts` — synchronous name resolution hook
     - `app/manage-books.tsx` — manage books screen

   - Delete cascade orchestration code (from fix #2):
     ```typescript
     // In app/manage-books.tsx
     const { deleteRecipe, recipes } = useRecipes();
     const { deleteSource } = useSources();
     
     const handleDeleteBook = useCallback(async (sourceId: SourceId) => {
       // 1. Delete all recipes referencing this source
       const recipesToDelete = recipes.filter((r) => r.metadata.source === sourceId);
       await Promise.all(recipesToDelete.map((r) => deleteRecipe(r.id)));
       // 2. Delete the source entity
       await deleteSource(sourceId);
     }, [recipes, deleteRecipe, deleteSource]);
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - No runtime errors encountered (this was spec writing, not implementation)
   - Spec validation identified 9 issues. Fixes 1-5 applied:
     1. Duplicate "### 4/5. Source Selector Updates" headers — removed duplicate, renumbered sections
     2. Delete cascade cross-context dependency — documented that manage-books screen orchestrates (has access to both contexts), added code example
     3. `useSourceName` in `lib/hooks/` violates module boundary — moved to `features/sources/hooks/`
     4. `app/recipe/add.tsx` direct `sourceHistoryRepository` import not noted — added explicit note in file changes table
     5. `SourceSelectorRef.confirmNewSource` return type change undocumented — added to SourceSelector changes section

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved the data model design: Sources promoted from bare strings to entities with UUIDs, enabling O(1) rename
   - Solved the delete cascade problem: Since `SourcesProvider` wraps `RecipesProvider`, the cascade must be orchestrated at the screen level
   - Solved source name resolution: Preloaded context with synchronous lookup eliminates async flicker
   - Solved the anchor positioning: `topTrailing` anchor for three-dots popover (same trailing edge, different vertical edge)

6. All user messages:
   - Selected "New feature" when asked about spec type
   - Described the full manage books feature with detailed UX requirements (swipe gestures, list styling, three-dots menu, popover morphing)
   - "We should change the data model so the source is a proper entity and renaming doesn't require a cascade but a property change on the entity."
   - "The add book button on the bottom should use the new source selector. It should be just a plus button on the bottom right that then triggers the form with checkmark/cancel. We should also display a back button on the bottom left that returns to the recipes list."
   - "Ahh, and my bad - the three dots button should be placed on top-right of the recipes list."
   - "Let's not bother with the migration - I'll remove all already added recipes manually. The app isn't used yet in production."
   - "I'm answering questions: 1. Delete confirmation - yes please add the extra dialog; include information, that this actions cannot be reversed and it'll remove all imported recipes from that book 2. Orphaned source display - the problem doesn't exist (see above) 3. Source name resolution latency - preload makes sense"
   - Invoked `/spec:validate`
   - "Please apply suggestions"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Apply remaining validation fixes #6-9 to the spec:
     - Fix #6: Add validation rules — reject empty/whitespace-only names, reject duplicate book names during add and rename
     - Fix #7: Fix i18n plural keys from `recipeCount_plural` to `recipeCount_one`/`recipeCount_other` (i18next convention)
     - Fix #8: Show explicit `useSources()` hook export in the SourcesContext section
     - Fix #9: Note that `getLastUsed()` is computed synchronously from the in-memory array (replicating the 24h check without async)

8. Current Work:
   Applying the 9 validation fixes identified by `/spec:validate` to `specs/016_manage_books/spec.md`. Fixes 1-5 have been applied. The most recent edit was Fix #5 — documenting the `SourceSelectorRef.confirmNewSource` return type change. The user's last message was "Please apply suggestions" referring to all 9 fixes from the validation report.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Continue applying fixes #6-9 to the spec. The user said "Please apply suggestions" and I was working through the list sequentially. Next is Fix #6: Add validation for empty/whitespace names and duplicate names in the Add Book and Rename sections of the spec.

# Decompose Specification into Tasks

Decompose the specification at: 

## Process Overview

This command takes a validated specification and breaks it down into:
1. Clear, actionable tasks with dependencies
2. Implementation phases and milestones
3. Testing and validation requirements
4. Documentation needs

!which stm &> /dev/null && test -d .simple-task-master && echo "STM_STATUS: Available and initialized" || (which stm &> /dev/null && echo "STM_STATUS: Available but not initialized" || echo "STM_STATUS: Not installed")

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Content Preservation Requirements

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART**: When creating STM tasks, you MUST copy ALL content from the task breakdown into the STM tasks. Do NOT summarize or reference the spec - include the ACTUAL CODE and details.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before creating any STM tasks, confirm your understanding:
- [ ] I will NOT write summaries like "Create X as specified in spec"
- [ ] I will COPY all code blocks from the task breakdown into STM --details
- [ ] I will USE heredocs or temp files for multi-line content
- [ ] I will INCLUDE complete implementations, not references
- [ ] Each STM task will be self-contained with ALL details from the breakdown

**If you find yourself typing phrases like "as specified", "from spec", or "see specification" - STOP and copy the actual content instead!**

## Instructions for Claude:

0. **Task Management System**:
   - Check the STM_STATUS output above
   - If status is "Available but not initialized", run: `stm init`
   - If status is "Available and initialized", use STM for task management
   - If status is "Not installed", fall back to TodoWrite

1. **Read and Validate Specification**:
   - Read the specified spec file
   - Verify it's a valid specification (has expected sections)
   - Extract implementation phases and technical details

2. **Analyze Specification Components**:
   - Identify major features and components
   - Extract technical requirements
   - Note dependencies between components
   - Identify testing requirements
   - Document success criteria

3. **Create Task Breakdown**:
   
   Break down the specification into concrete, actionable tasks.
   
   Key principles:
   - Each task should have a single, clear objective
   - **PRESERVE ALL CONTENT**: Copy implementation details, code blocks, and examples verbatim from the spec
   - Define clear acceptance criteria with specific test scenarios
   - Include tests as part of each task
   - Document dependencies between tasks
     * Write meaningful tests that can fail to reveal real issues
     * Follow project principle: "When tests fail, fix the code, not the test"
   - Create foundation tasks first, then build features on top
   - Each task should be self-contained with all necessary details
   
   **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: When creating tasks, you MUST preserve:
   - Complete code examples (including full functions, not just snippets)
   - All technical requirements and specifications
   - Detailed implementation steps
   - Configuration examples
   - Error handling requirements
   - All acceptance criteria and test scenarios
   
   Think of each task as a complete mini-specification that contains everything needed to implement it without referring back to the original spec.
   
   ## 📋 THE TWO-STEP PROCESS YOU MUST FOLLOW:
   
   **Step 1**: Create the task breakdown DOCUMENT with all details
   **Step 2**: Copy those SAME details into STM tasks
   
   The task breakdown document is NOT just for reference - it's the SOURCE for your STM task content!
   
   Task structure:
   - Foundation tasks: Core infrastructure (database, frameworks, testing setup)
   - Feature tasks: Complete vertical slices including all layers
   - Testing tasks: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
   - Documentation tasks: API docs, user guides, code comments

4. **Generate Task Document**:

   Create a comprehensive task breakdown document:
   
   ```markdown
   # Task Breakdown: [Specification Name]
   Generated: [Date]
   Source: [spec-file]
   
   ## Overview
   [Brief summary of what's being built]
   
   ## Phase 1: Foundation
   
   ### Task 1.1: [Task Title]
   **Description**: One-line summary of what needs to be done
   **Size**: Small/Medium/Large
   **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
   **Dependencies**: None
   **Can run parallel with**: Task 1.2, 1.3
   
   **Technical Requirements**:
   - [All technical details from spec]
   - [Specific library versions]
   - [Code examples from spec]
   
   **Implementation Steps**:
   1. [Detailed step from spec]
   2. [Another step with specifics]
   3. [Continue with all steps]
   
   **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - [ ] [Specific criteria from spec]
   - [ ] Tests written and passing
   - [ ] [Additional criteria]
   
   ## Phase 2: Core Features
   [Continue pattern...]
   ```
   
   Example task breakdown:
   ```markdown
   ### Task 2.3: Implement file system operations with backup support
   **Description**: Build filesystem.ts module with Unix-focused operations and backup support
   **Size**: Large
   **Priority**: High
   **Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (TypeScript setup), Task 1.2 (Project structure)
   **Can run parallel with**: Task 2.4 (Config module)
   
   **Source**: specs/feat-modernize-setup-installer.md
   
   **Technical Requirements**:
   - Path validation: Basic checks for reasonable paths
   - Permission checks: Verify write permissions before operations
   - Backup creation: Simple backup before overwriting files
   - Error handling: Graceful failure with helpful messages
   - Unix path handling: Use path.join, os.homedir(), standard Unix permissions
   
   **Functions to implement**:
   - validateProjectPath(input: string): boolean - Basic path validation
   - ensureDirectoryExists(path: string): Promise<void>
   - copyFileWithBackup(source: string, target: string, backup: boolean): Promise<void>
   - setExecutablePermission(filePath: string): Promise<void> - chmod 755
   - needsUpdate(source: string, target: string): Promise<boolean> - SHA-256 comparison
   - getFileHash(filePath: string): Promise<string> - SHA-256 hash generation
   
   **Implementation example from spec**:
   ```typescript
   async function needsUpdate(source: string, target: string): Promise<boolean> {
     if (!await fs.pathExists(target)) return true;
     
     const sourceHash = await getFileHash(source);
     const targetHash = await getFileHash(target);
     
     return sourceHash !== targetHash;
   }
   ```
   
   **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - [ ] All file operations handle Unix paths correctly
   - [ ] SHA-256 based idempotency checking implemented
   - [ ] Backup functionality creates timestamped backups
   - [ ] Executable permissions set correctly for hooks (755)
   - [ ] Path validation prevents directory traversal
   - [ ] Tests: All operations work on macOS/Linux with proper error handling
   ```
   
5. **Create Task Management Entries**:
   
   ## 🚨 STOP AND READ: Common Mistake vs Correct Approach
   
   ❌ **WRONG - What NOT to do**:
   ```bash
   stm add "[P1.3] Implement common hook utilities" \
     --description "Create shared utilities module for all hooks" \
     --details "Create cli/hooks/utils.ts with readStdin() with 1-second timeout, findProjectRoot() using git rev-parse, detectPackageManager() checking lock files" \
     --validation "readStdin with timeout. Project root discovery. Package manager detection."
   ```
   
   ✅ **CORRECT - What you MUST do**:
   ```bash
   # For each task in the breakdown, find the corresponding section and COPY ALL its content
   # Use temporary files for large content to preserve formatting
   
   cat > /tmp/task-details.txt << 'EOF'
   Create cli/hooks/utils.ts with the following implementations:
   
   ```typescript
   import { exec } from 'child_process';
   import { promisify } from 'util';
   import * as fs from 'fs-extra';
   import * as path from 'path';
   
   const execAsync = promisify(exec);
   
   // Standard input reader
   export async function readStdin(): Promise<string> {
     return new Promise((resolve) => {
       let data = '';
       process.stdin.on('data', chunk => data += chunk);
       process.stdin.on('end', () => resolve(data));
       setTimeout(() => resolve(''), 1000); // Timeout fallback
     });
   }
   
   // Project root discovery
   export async function findProjectRoot(startDir: string = process.cwd()): Promise<string> {
     try {
       const { stdout } = await execAsync('git rev-parse --show-toplevel', { cwd: startDir });
       return stdout.trim();
     } catch {
       return process.cwd();
     }
   }
   
   // [Include ALL other functions from the task breakdown...]
   ```
   
   Technical Requirements:
   - Standard input reader with timeout
   - Project root discovery using git
   - Package manager detection (npm/yarn/pnpm)
   - Command execution wrapper
   - Error formatting helper
   - Tool availability checker
   EOF
   
   stm add "[P1.3] Implement common hook utilities" \
     --description "Create shared utilities module for all hooks with stdin reader, project root discovery, package manager detection, command execution wrapper, error formatting, and tool availability checking" \
     --details "$(cat /tmp/task-details.txt)" \
     --validation "readStdin with 1-second timeout. Project root discovery via git. Package manager detection for npm/yarn/pnpm. Command execution with timeout and output capture. Error formatting follows BLOCKED: pattern. Tool availability checker works." \
     --tags "phase1,infrastructure,utilities"
   
   rm /tmp/task-details.txt
   ```
   
   **Remember**: The task breakdown document you created has ALL the implementation details. Your job is to COPY those details into STM, not summarize them!
   
   ```bash
   # Example: Creating a task with complete specification details
   
   # Method 1: Using heredocs for multi-line content
   stm add "Implement auto-checkpoint hook logic" \
     --description "Build the complete auto-checkpoint functionality with git integration to create timestamped git stashes on Stop events" \
     --details "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Technical Requirements:
   - Check if current directory is git repository using git status
   - Detect uncommitted changes using git status --porcelain
   - Create timestamped stash with configurable prefix from config
   - Apply stash to restore working directory after creation
   - Handle exit codes properly (0 for success, 1 for errors)
   
   Implementation from specification:
   ```typescript
   const hookName = process.argv[2];
   if (hookName !== 'auto-checkpoint') {
     console.error(`Unknown hook: ${hookName}`);
     process.exit(1);
   }
   
   const hookConfig = config.hooks?.['auto-checkpoint'] || {};
   const prefix = hookConfig.prefix || 'claude';
   
   const gitStatus = spawn('git', ['status', '--porcelain'], {
     stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']
   });
   
   let stdout = '';
   gitStatus.stdout.on('data', (data) => stdout += data);
   
   gitStatus.on('close', (code) => {
     if (code !== 0) {
       console.log('Not a git repository, skipping checkpoint');
       process.exit(0);
     }
     
     if (!stdout.trim()) {
       console.log('No changes to checkpoint');
       process.exit(0);
     }
     
     const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
     const message = `${prefix}-checkpoint-${timestamp}`;
     
     const stash = spawn('git', ['stash', 'push', '-m', message], {
       stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']
     });
     
     stash.on('close', (stashCode) => {
       if (stashCode !== 0) {
         console.error('Failed to create checkpoint');
         process.exit(1);
       }
       
       spawn('git', ['stash', 'apply'], {
         stdio: 'ignore'
       }).on('close', () => {
         console.log(`✅ Checkpoint created: ${message}`);
         process.exit(0);
       });
     });
   });
   ```
   
   Key implementation notes:
   - Use child_process.spawn for git commands
   - Capture stdout to check for changes
   - Generate ISO timestamp and sanitize for git message
   - Chain git stash push and apply operations
   EOF
   )" \
     --validation "$(cat <<'EOF'
   - [ ] Correctly identifies git repositories
   - [ ] Detects uncommitted changes using git status --porcelain
   - [ ] Creates checkpoint with format: ${prefix}-checkpoint-${timestamp}
   - [ ] Restores working directory after stash
   - [ ] Exits with code 0 on success, 1 on error
   - [ ] Respects configured prefix from .claudekit/config.json
   - [ ] Handles missing config file gracefully
   
   Test scenarios:
   1. Run in non-git directory - should exit 0
   2. Run with no changes - should exit 0
   3. Run with changes - should create checkpoint
   4. Run with custom config - should use custom prefix

   **Important STM field usage**:
   - `--description`: Brief what & why (1-2 sentences max)
   - `--details`: Complete technical implementation including:
     - All technical requirements from spec
     - Full code examples with proper formatting (COPY from breakdown, don't summarize!)
     - Implementation steps and notes
     - Architecture decisions
     - **MUST be self-contained** - someone should be able to implement the task without seeing the original spec
   - `--validation`: Complete acceptance criteria including:
     - All test scenarios
     - Success/failure conditions
     - Edge cases to verify
   
   ## Content Size Guidelines
   
   - **Small tasks (< 20 lines)**: Can use heredocs directly in command
   - **Medium tasks (20-200 lines)**: Use temporary files to preserve formatting
   - **Large tasks (> 200 lines)**: Always use temporary files
   - **Tasks with code blocks**: MUST use heredocs or files (never inline)
   
   Example for medium/large content:
   ```bash
   # Extract the full implementation from your task breakdown
   cat > /tmp/stm-task-details.txt << 'EOF'
   [PASTE THE ENTIRE "Technical Requirements" and "Implementation" sections from the task breakdown]
   [Include ALL code blocks with proper formatting]
   [Include ALL technical notes and comments]
   EOF
   
   cat > /tmp/stm-task-validation.txt << 'EOF'
   [PASTE THE ENTIRE "Acceptance Criteria" section]
   [Include ALL test scenarios]
   EOF
   
   stm add "[Task Title]" \
     --description "[One line summary]" \
     --details "$(cat /tmp/stm-task-details.txt)" \
     --validation "$(cat /tmp/stm-task-validation.txt)" \
     --tags "appropriate,tags" \
     --deps "1,2,3"
   
   rm /tmp/stm-task-*.txt
   ```
   
   If STM is not available, use TodoWrite:
   ```javascript
   [
     {
       id: "1",
       content: "Phase 1: Set up TypeScript project structure",
       status: "pending",
       priority: "high"
     },
     {
       id: "2",
       content: "Phase 1: Configure build system with esbuild",
       status: "pending",
       priority: "high"
     },
     // ... additional tasks
   ]
   ```

6. **Save Task Breakdown**:
   - Save the detailed task breakdown document to `specs/[spec-name]-plan.md`
   - Create tasks in STM or TodoWrite for immediate tracking
   - Generate a summary report showing:
     - Total number of tasks
     - Breakdown by phase
     - Parallel execution opportunities
     - Task management system used (STM or TodoWrite)

## Output Format

### Task Breakdown Document
The generated markdown file includes:
- Executive summary
- Phase-by-phase task breakdown
- Dependency graph
- Risk assessment
- Execution strategy

### Task Management Integration
Tasks are immediately available in STM (if installed) or TodoWrite for:
- Progress tracking
- Status updates
- Blocking issue identification
- Parallel work coordination
- Dependency tracking (STM only)
- Persistent storage across sessions (STM only)

### Summary Report
Displays:
- Total tasks created
- Tasks per phase
- Critical path identification
- Recommended execution order

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Decompose a feature specification
/spec:decompose specs/feat-user-authentication.md

# Decompose a system enhancement spec
/spec:decompose specs/feat-api-rate-limiting.md
```

## Success Criteria

The decomposition is complete when:
- ✅ Task breakdown document is saved to specs directory
- ✅ All tasks are created in STM (if available) or TodoWrite for tracking
- ✅ **Tasks preserve ALL implementation details from the spec including:**
  - Complete code blocks and examples (not summarized)
  - Full technical requirements and specifications
  - Detailed step-by-step implementation instructions
  - All configuration examples
  - Complete acceptance criteria with test scenarios
- ✅ Foundation tasks are identified and prioritized
- ✅ Dependencies between tasks are clearly documented
- ✅ All tasks include testing requirements
- ✅ Parallel execution opportunities are identified
- ✅ **STM tasks use all three fields properly:**
  - `--description`: Brief what & why (1-2 sentences)
  - `--details`: Complete technical implementation from spec (ACTUAL CODE, not references)
  - `--validation`: Full acceptance criteria and test scenarios
- ✅ **Quality check passed**: Running `stm show [any-task-id]` displays full code implementations
- ✅ **No summary phrases**: Tasks don't contain "as specified", "from spec", or similar references

## Post-Creation Validation

After creating STM tasks, perform these checks:

1. **Sample Task Review**:
   ```bash
   # Pick a random task and check it has full implementation
   stm show [task-id] | grep -E "(as specified|from spec|see specification)"
   # Should return NO matches - if it does, the task is incomplete
   ```

2. **Content Length Check**:
   ```bash
   # Implementation tasks should have substantial details
   stm list --format json | jq '.[] | select(.details | length < 500) | {id, title}'
   # Review any tasks with very short details - they likely need more content
   ```

3. **Code Block Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Check that tasks contain actual code blocks
   stm grep "```" | wc -l
   # Should show many matches for tasks with code implementations
   ```

## Integration with Other Commands

- **Prerequisites**: Run `/spec:validate` first to ensure spec quality
- **Next step**: Use `/spec:execute` to implement the decomposed tasks
- **Progress tracking**: 
  - With STM: `stm list --pretty` or `stm list --status pending`
  - With TodoWrite: Monitor task completion in session
- **Quality checks**: Run `/validate-and-fix` after implementation

## Best Practices

1. **Task Granularity**: Keep tasks focused on single objectives
2. **Dependencies**: Clearly identify blocking vs parallel work
3. **Testing**: Include test tasks for each component
4. **Documentation**: Add documentation tasks alongside implementation
5. **Phases**: Group related tasks into logical phases

The panel that appears for the three dots button should appear next to that button not always in the bottom right corner. For the plus button, it should appear there. In general, it should appear in the corner where the triggering button is located - and the fake button used for morphing should follow that layout.
