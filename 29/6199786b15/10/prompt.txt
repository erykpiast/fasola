Context: manage books screen, the books list row item actions.

I measured the action buttons size in the native Apple iOS app (Reminders) that we're trying to mimic and:

1. The button height is 108 px
1. The icon height is 60 px (edge to edge for the white pixels in the trash image)
1. The label size is 32 px (the height of the letter "l" in "Delete")
1. Gap between the label and the button is 20 px
1. The border radius of the gray background behind the item title is 64 px
1. #2c2b2d - the gray background color

**Implementation Completeness:**
• Did you create a mock implementation just to pass tests instead of real functionality?

**Code Quality:**
• Are you using different patterns than the existing code uses?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Does the code structure still make sense after your additions?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Are you following the same patterns used elsewhere in the codebase?

The action button must have 28 px horizontal margin around - from both the gray background of the item and the edge of the screen.
