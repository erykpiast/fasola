**Implementation Completeness:**
• Does the implementation actually do what it claims, or just return hardcoded values?

**Code Quality:**
• Is every piece of code still serving a clear purpose?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Does the code structure still make sense after your additions?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Should other parts of the codebase be updated to match your improvements?

💡 **Tip:** The code-review-expert subagent is available. Use it to review each self-review topic.
