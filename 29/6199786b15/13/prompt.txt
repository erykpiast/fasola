Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Add "About the app" Screen

## Context

The app currently has a single global menu option ("Your Books"). The user wants an "About" screen accessible from this menu, providing app info, author details, and a feedback CTA.

## Changes

### 1. Add translation keys

**File:** `platform/i18n/translations/en.json`

Add `menu.about` and a new `about.*` namespace with all user-facing strings: title, intro paragraph (passion/privacy/open-source), GitHub link label, author section (name, email, copyright, bio), help section (encouragement text, CTA label).

### 2. Add icon fallbacks for non-iOS

**File:** `modules/liquid-glass/src/LiquidGlassButton.tsx`

Add two entries to `SF_SYMBOL_TO_IONICON`:
- `"info.circle"` -> `"information-circle-outline"`
- `"envelope"` -> `"mail-outline"`

### 3. Add "About" menu option

**File:** `features/recipes-list/hooks/useGlobalOptions.ts`

- Append `{ id: "about", label: t("menu.about"), systemImage: "info.circle" }` to the `options` array
- Add `else if (id === "about") { router.push("/about"); }` in `handleSelect`

### 4. Create the About screen

**File (new):** `app/about.tsx`

Layout follows `manage-books.tsx` pattern:
- Full-screen container with `colors.background`
- Header: "About fasola" at `fontSize: 34, fontWeight: "bold"`, `paddingHorizontal: 28`, `paddingTop: insets.top + 16`
- `ScrollView` with `paddingHorizontal: 28`, `paddingBottom: 120` (room for bottom buttons)
- Three sections separated by `marginBottom: 32`:
  - **Intro**: paragraph about passion/privacy/open-source + tappable "View source on GitHub" link (opens via `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync`)
  - **Author**: name, email, copyright line, bio paragraph
  - **Get help**: encouragement paragraph
- Arrow: unicode arrow character, right-aligned, below the help text, pointing toward the CTA
- `BackButton` component (bottom-left, reused from `lib/components/atoms/BackButton.tsx`)
- CTA `LiquidGlassButton` with `systemImage="envelope"` (bottom-right, same positioning as `EditButton`: `position: "absolute", bottom: 28, right: 28, zIndex: 10`)
- CTA opens `mailto:eryk.napierala@gmail.com?subject=fasola%20feedback` via `Linking.openURL`
- Text colors: `isDark ? "#FFFFFF" : "#000000"` for headings/name, `colors.textSecondary` for body text, `colors.text` for the GitHub link (branded purple in light mode)

## Files Summary

| File | Action |
|---|---|
| `platform/i18n/translations/en.json` | Modify |
| `modules/liquid-glass/src/LiquidGlassButton.tsx` | Modify |
| `features/recipes-list/hooks/useGlobalOptions.ts` | Modify |
| `app/about.tsx` | Create |

## Verification

1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify types
2. Open the app, tap the ellipsis menu - "About" option should appear with (i) icon
3. Tap "About" - screen renders with header, three sections, arrow, back button, envelope CTA
4. Tap "View source on GitHub" - opens browser to `https://github.com/erykpiast/fasola`
5. Tap envelope CTA - opens email client with prefilled address and subject
6. Tap back button - returns to home screen
7. Test dark mode - text colors adapt correctly
