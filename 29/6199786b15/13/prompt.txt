Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Add "About the app" Screen

## Context

The app currently has a single global menu option ("Your Books"). The user wants an "About" screen accessible from this menu, providing app info, author details, and a feedback CTA.

## Changes

### 1. Add translation keys

**File:** `platform/i18n/translations/en.json`

Add `menu.about` and a new `about.*` namespace with all user-facing strings: title, intro paragraph (passion/privacy/open-source), GitHub link label, author section (name, email, copyright, bio), help section (encouragement text, CTA label).

### 2. Add icon fallbacks for non-iOS

**File:** `modules/liquid-glass/src/LiquidGlassButton.tsx`

Add two entries to `SF_SYMBOL_TO_IONICON`:
- `"info.circle"` -> `"information-circle-outline"`
- `"envelope"` -> `"mail-outline"`

### 3. Add "About" menu option

**File:** `features/recipes-list/hooks/useGlobalOptions.ts`

- Append `{ id: "about", label: t("menu.about"), systemImage: "info.circle" }` to the `options` array
- Add `else if (id === "about") { router.push("/about"); }` in `handleSelect`

### 4. Create the About screen

**File (new):** `app/about.tsx`

Layout follows `manage-books.tsx` pattern:
- Full-screen container with `colors.background`
- Header: "About fasola" at `fontSize: 34, fontWeight: "bold"`, `paddingHorizontal: 28`, `paddingTop: insets.top + 16`
- `ScrollView` with `paddingHorizontal: 28`, `paddingBottom: 120` (room for bottom buttons)
- Three sections separated by `marginBottom: 32`:
  - **Intro**: paragraph about passion/privacy/open-source + tappable "View source on GitHub" link (opens via `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync`)
  - **Author**: name, email, copyright line, bio paragraph
  - **Get help**: encouragement paragraph
- Arrow: unicode arrow character, right-aligned, below the help text, pointing toward the CTA
- `BackButton` component (bottom-left, reused from `lib/components/atoms/BackButton.tsx`)
- CTA `LiquidGlassButton` with `systemImage="envelope"` (bottom-right, same positioning as `EditButton`: `position: "absolute", bottom: 28, right: 28, zIndex: 10`)
- CTA opens `mailto:eryk.napierala@gmail.com?subject=fasola%20feedback` via `Linking.openURL`
- Text colors: `isDark ? "#FFFFFF" : "#000000"` for headings/name, `colors.textSecondary` for body text, `colors.text` for the GitHub link (branded purple in light mode)

## Files Summary

| File | Action |
|---|---|
| `platform/i18n/translations/en.json` | Modify |
| `modules/liquid-glass/src/LiquidGlassButton.tsx` | Modify |
| `features/recipes-list/hooks/useGlobalOptions.ts` | Modify |
| `app/about.tsx` | Create |

## Verification

1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify types
2. Open the app, tap the ellipsis menu - "About" option should appear with (i) icon
3. Tap "About" - screen renders with header, three sections, arrow, back button, envelope CTA
4. Tap "View source on GitHub" - opens browser to `https://github.com/erykpiast/fasola`
5. Tap envelope CTA - opens email client with prefilled address and subject
6. Tap back button - returns to home screen
7. Test dark mode - text colors adapt correctly

## Pre-Review Analysis: Think This Through End-to-End

Before launching review agents, analyze the complete impact and context:

### Impact Assessment
- **System Impact**: What systems, services, or components could be affected by these changes?
- **Deployment Context**: What's the risk level and timeline for these changes?
- **Integration Points**: Are there external dependencies, APIs, or team workflows involved?
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Who depends on the code being reviewed?

### Review Strategy Coordination
Based on impact assessment and ****, determine:
- **Critical vs. Nice-to-Have**: Which review aspects are CRITICAL vs. optional for this change?
- **Potential Conflicts**: Could findings from different review areas suggest competing solutions?
- **Shared Context**: What context should all review agents be aware of?
- **Appropriate Rigor**: What level of analysis matches the change scope and risk?

## Review Strategy

Based on **** and the impact assessment above, determine which review agents are needed:

If reviewing "changes" or recent modifications:
1. Analyze the file types that have been modified
2. Launch only relevant review agents:
   - **Documentation files only** (*.md, *.txt, README): Launch only Documentation & API Review agent
   - **Test files only** (*test.*, *.spec.*, tests/): Launch Testing Quality Review and Code Quality Review agents
   - **Config files only** (*.json, *.yaml, *.toml, .*rc): Launch Security & Dependencies Review and Architecture Review agents
   - **Source code files** (*.ts, *.js, *.py, etc.): Launch all 6 review agents
   - **Mixed changes**: Launch agents relevant to each file type present

If reviewing a specific directory or broad scope:
- Launch all 6 review agents for comprehensive coverage

Use the Task tool to invoke the appropriate code-review-expert agents concurrently with enhanced thinking trigger instructions:

## 1. Architecture & Design Review
```
Subagent: code-review-expert
Description: Architecture review with end-to-end analysis
Prompt: Review the architecture and design patterns in: 

CONTEXT: [Include findings from Pre-Review Analysis above - system impact, deployment context, integration points]

Primary Focus: module organization, separation of concerns, dependency management, abstraction levels, design pattern usage, and architectural consistency. Check available experts with claudekit for domain-specific patterns.

THINK THIS THROUGH END-TO-END:
- Trace architectural impacts: How does this change affect all dependent systems?
- Map the complete data/control flow through the architecture
- Identify what breaks when components fail or change
- Consider the full deployment and integration pipeline
- Analyze how this fits into the broader system architecture

Check available experts with claudekit for domain-specific patterns.
```

## 2. Code Quality Review
```
Subagent: code-review-expert
Description: Code quality review  
Prompt: Review code quality and maintainability in: 
Focus on: readability, naming conventions, code complexity, DRY principles, code smells, refactoring opportunities, and consistent coding patterns. Pull domain-specific quality metrics from available experts.
```

## 3. Security & Dependencies Review
```
Subagent: code-review-expert
Description: Security and dependencies review with alternative hypothesis analysis
Prompt: Perform security and dependency analysis of: 

CONTEXT: [Include findings from Pre-Review Analysis above - system impact, deployment context, integration points]

Primary Focus: input validation, injection vulnerabilities, authentication/authorization, secrets management, dependency vulnerabilities, license compliance, version pinning, and supply chain security. Use security insights from domain experts if available.

CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES:
- Beyond obvious vulnerabilities, what other attack vectors exist?
- How else could these security controls be bypassed or exploited?
- What assumptions about user behavior, data flow, or system boundaries could an attacker violate?
- Are there alternative explanations for apparent security measures?
- What if the current security model is fundamentally flawed?

Use security insights from domain experts if available.
```

## 4. Performance & Scalability Review
```
Subagent: code-review-expert
Description: Performance and scalability review
Prompt: Analyze performance and scalability in: 
Focus on: algorithm complexity, memory usage, database queries, caching strategies, async patterns, resource management, load handling, and horizontal scaling considerations. Get performance patterns from relevant experts.
```

## 5. Testing Quality Review
```
Subagent: code-review-expert
Description: Testing quality review
Prompt: Review test quality and effectiveness for: 
Focus on: meaningful assertions, test isolation, edge case handling, failure scenario coverage, mock vs real dependencies balance, test maintainability, clear test names, and actual behavior verification (not just coverage metrics). Check for testing-expert insights if available.
```

## 6. Documentation & API Review
```
Subagent: code-review-expert
Description: Documentation and API review
Prompt: Review documentation and API design for: 

Focus on: README completeness, API documentation, breaking changes, code comments, JSDoc/TypeDoc coverage, usage examples, migration guides, and developer experience. Evaluate API consistency and contract clarity.

Documentation Review Guidelines:
- Consider purpose and audience: Who needs this information and why?
- Evaluate effectiveness: Does the documentation achieve its goals?
- Focus on clarity: Can users understand and apply the information?
- Identify real issues: Missing information, errors, contradictions, outdated content
- Respect intentional variation: Multiple examples may show different valid approaches
```

## Post-Review Consolidation: Consider Alternative Hypotheses

After all agents complete, apply alternative hypothesis thinking before consolidating:

### Cross-Pattern Analysis
- **Competing Solutions**: Do findings from different review areas suggest conflicting solutions or approaches?
- **Alternative Explanations**: Are there alternative explanations for patterns seen across multiple review areas?
- **Root Cause Investigation**: Could the same underlying issue be manifesting in multiple review aspects?
- **Intentional Trade-offs**: What if apparent "problems" are actually intentional design decisions with valid reasoning?

### Prioritization with Context
- **Real vs. Theoretical Issues**: Which issues matter given the actual deployment context and timeline?
- **Conflicting Recommendations**: How do we sequence fixes that might conflict with each other?
- **Alternative Approaches**: If obvious fixes prove problematic, what are the alternative solutions?

Then consolidate findings into this structured format:
