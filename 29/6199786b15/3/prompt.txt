Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Fix overflow popover morph alignment

## Context

Two remaining issues with the overflow popover morph:
1. **2px vertical offset**: The morph circle's top edge matches the button container's top edge, but the visual glass circle inside the button is centered within the 48pt container. User measured a 2px gap — the panel needs to be 2px higher.
2. **Button not hidden during morph**: The real three-dots button stays visible behind the semi-transparent glass panel, breaking the morph illusion. The plus button already fades out correctly via `usePopoverTransition` — the overflow button needs the same treatment.

## Changes

### 1. `app/index.tsx` — fade overflow button + fix offset

**Fix 2px offset**: Change `buttonOffset.y` from `insets.top + 8` to `insets.top + 6`.

**Fade overflow button**: Reuse `usePopoverTransition` (same hook the plus button uses at line 59):
```typescript
const { buttonStyle: overflowButtonStyle } = usePopoverTransition(overflowVisible, false);
```

Change the overflow button wrapper from `View` to `Animated.View`, apply the animated style:
```tsx
<Animated.View
  style={[styles.overflowButton, { top: insets.top + 8 }, overflowButtonStyle]}
  pointerEvents={popoverVisible || overflowVisible ? "none" : "auto"}
>
```

`usePopoverTransition` returns `buttonStyle` = `{ opacity: 1 - progress }` with spring animation (`damping: 40, stiffness: 200`). Identical to how the plus button fades. The hook also calls `Keyboard.dismiss()` when the popover opens — correct behavior.

No other files need changes.

## Verification

1. Tap three-dots → button fades out, morph starts at exact button position (no 2px gap)
2. Dismiss → button fades back in
3. Tap plus button → import popover morph still works, plus button fades (regression)
4. Open overflow while keyboard is up → keyboard dismisses

**Implementation Completeness:**
• Did you implement the full solution or just the minimum to make tests green?

**Code Quality:**
• Are you using different patterns than the existing code uses?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Did you just add code on top without integrating it properly?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Should your solution be applied elsewhere for consistency?

Please compare impementations for the plus and three dots buttons. The morp effect looks worse for the three dots. The transition is less smooth and it's easy to spot that the panel appears from nowhere.
