Implement the following plan:

# Plan: LiquidGlassPopover buttonOffset prop

## Context

The popover's internal morphing button is positioned with hardcoded padding that doesn't match the actual trigger button's position. The overflow (three-dots) button is at `right: 28, top: insets.top + 8` but the popover's fake button renders at `trailing: 28, top: safeArea + 28` — a 20pt vertical gap that causes a visible jump on morph.

General rule: the popover's fake morphing button must exactly overlap the real trigger button. The `anchor` enum picks the corner layout, but the exact offset within that corner must be caller-controlled.

## Solution: `buttonOffset` prop

Add `buttonOffset?: { x: number; y: number }` to `LiquidGlassPopoverProps`.

- `x`: distance from trailing (right) screen edge to the button's trailing edge
- `y`: distance from anchor edge (bottom for `bottomTrailing`, top for `topTrailing`) to the button's corresponding edge
- Default: `{ x: 28, y: 28 }` — preserves existing import popover behavior
- Caller handles safe area insets — no internal safe area calculation in native code

## Files to change

### 1. `modules/liquid-glass/src/LiquidGlassPopover.types.ts`
Add `buttonOffset` to props type:
```typescript
export type LiquidGlassPopoverProps = {
  // ...existing
  buttonOffset?: { x: number; y: number };
};
```

### 2. `modules/liquid-glass/src/LiquidGlassPopover.ios.tsx`
Pass `buttonOffset` to native view. Convert `{ x, y }` to the format expected by native (dict).

### 3. `modules/liquid-glass/ios/LiquidGlassModule.swift`
Register `buttonOffset` prop:
```swift
Prop("buttonOffset") { (view, offset: [String: CGFloat]) in
  view.setButtonOffset(offset)
}
```

### 4. `modules/liquid-glass/ios/LiquidGlassPopoverView.swift`
- Add `buttonOffsetX: CGFloat = 28` and `buttonOffsetY: CGFloat = 28` properties on `LiquidGlassPopoverView`
- Pass them through to `LiquidGlassPopoverContent`
- Add `setButtonOffset` method parsing `{ "x": N, "y": N }` dict
- Replace hardcoded padding in `anchoredLayout`:
  - `bottomTrailing`: `.padding(.trailing, buttonOffsetX).padding(.bottom, buttonOffsetY)`
  - `topTrailing`: `.padding(.trailing, buttonOffsetX).padding(.top, buttonOffsetY)`
- Delete `topSafeAreaInset` computed property (caller provides the full offset including safe area)

### 5. `modules/liquid-glass/src/LiquidGlassPopover.tsx` (non-iOS fallback)
Use `buttonOffset` values for positioning instead of hardcoded `paddingTop: 60, paddingRight: 16`:
- `bottomTrailing`: `paddingRight: offset.x, paddingBottom: offset.y`, flex-end alignment
- `topTrailing`: `paddingRight: offset.x, paddingTop: offset.y`, flex-start/flex-end alignment

### 6. `app/index.tsx`
Update overflow popover to pass explicit offset matching the real button position:
```typescript
<LiquidGlassPopover
  visible={overflowVisible}
  anchor="topTrailing"
  buttonOffset={{ x: 28, y: insets.top + 8 }}
  options={overflowOptions}
  buttonSize={44}
  onSelect={handleOverflowSelect}
  onDismiss={handleOverflowDismiss}
/>
```
Import popover unchanged — default `{ x: 28, y: 28 }` already matches its button.

### 7. Spec/plan docs
Update `specs/016_manage_books/spec.md` section 6 prop table and `specs/016_manage_books/plan.md` Task 10/11 to reflect `buttonOffset`.

## Verification

1. `npx expo run:ios`
2. Tap three-dots button → morph starts exactly at the button, no jump
3. Tap plus button → import popover morph starts exactly at that button (regression check)
4. Dismiss both → morph collapses back to exact button position
5. Non-iOS fallback: menu appears near the correct corner with proper padding

It's still not what I meant. The three dots button appears in the top rigth corner of the screen and the panel should appear there as well.

From my manual measures, the panel should appear two pixels higher to be aligned with the button. Then, what's even more wrong - the button must fadeout when the panel is visible to make the morph effect. See how it's done for the plus button and the import source selection panel.
