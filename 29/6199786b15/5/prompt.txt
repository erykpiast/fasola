Implement the following plan:

# Fix Bottom Bar Vertical Alignment in Manage Books

## Context

On the manage-books screen, when the "add book" input is shown, the two LiquidGlassButton components and the LiquidGlassInput are not vertically aligned - the text input sits a few pixels lower than the buttons. The user wants this to match the SourceSelector component's alignment.

**Root cause**: Two compounding issues:
1. LiquidGlassButton renders at height **48px**, while LiquidGlassInput with variant="form" renders at height **56px** (8px taller).
2. The bottomBar style uses flexDirection: "row" but has no alignItems - defaulting to stretch, which does not vertically center mismatched-height children.

**Why SourceSelector works**: It explicitly sets height: 48 on the glassSelect style (SourceSelector.tsx:302), overriding the form variant's default 56px to match button height.

## Fix

**File**: app/manage-books.tsx

1. Add alignItems: "center" to the bottomBar style - vertically centers all children regardless of height differences.
2. Add style={{ height: 48 }} to the LiquidGlassInput in the add-book branch - matches the SourceSelector pattern (glassSelect: { height: 48 }) and ensures the input is the same height as the buttons.

Both changes together ensure pixel-perfect alignment matching the SourceSelector component.

## Verification

1. npx tsc --noEmit passes
2. Open manage-books on iOS simulator, tap "plus" - buttons and input field sit on the same vertical line
3. Compare visually with the add-recipe screen's source selector input - alignment should match

📋 **Self-Review**

Please review these aspects of your changes:

**Implementation Completeness:**
• Did you implement the full solution or just the minimum to make tests green?

**Code Quality:**
• Are you using different patterns than the existing code uses?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Would refactoring the surrounding code make everything simpler?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Should other parts of the codebase be updated to match your improvements?

Let's refactor index.tsx in the main component. There is too much logic related to different constraints. Let's extract some hooks that contain different pieces of the logic, for example, related to the input option. Just figure it out.

Refactor the main component in `index.tsx`. There is too much mixed logic related to different concerns. Let's groupd related pieces in custom hooks.
