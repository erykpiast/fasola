Implement the following plan:

# Fix: ProcessingIndicator not visible on recipe preview

## Context

When a recipe is pending or processing, the `ProcessingIndicator` component is correctly mounted (the same `recipe.status` check that disables the edit button also gates the indicator), but it renders as 0x0 pixels due to a layout collapse.

## Root Cause

In `RecipeViewScreen.tsx` (line 95), the wrapper `<View pointerEvents="none">` has **no style**. All its children use `position: "absolute"`:

- `MetadataOverlay` — absolute, but specifies its own height via padding/content, so it overflows and remains visible
- `ProcessingIndicator` — absolute with `top:0, left:0, right:0, bottom:0`, so its dimensions are **derived from the parent**. Parent is 0x0 → indicator is 0x0
- `DebugVisualization` — absolute

Since no child contributes intrinsic height, the parent View collapses to 0x0. ProcessingIndicator inherits that zero size.

## Fix

Add `StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject` to the wrapper View at line 95 of `features/recipe-preview/components/RecipeViewScreen.tsx`:

```tsx
// Before:
<View pointerEvents="none">

// After:
<View pointerEvents="none" style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}>
```

This makes the View fill the overlay Animated.View. Since it's absolutely positioned, it doesn't affect the sibling button layout. `pointerEvents="none"` already ensures touches pass through to the buttons.

### File to modify
- `features/recipe-preview/components/RecipeViewScreen.tsx` — line 95 only

## Verification

1. Import a new photo and navigate to its recipe preview while processing is in progress
2. Confirm the ActivityIndicator spinner and rotating progress messages appear centered on screen
3. Confirm the edit button remains disabled during processing
4. Confirm the back, delete, and edit buttons remain tappable (not blocked by the pointer-events-none overlay)
5. Confirm MetadataOverlay still displays correctly on ready recipes

let's add the radial gradient to the overlay, the loading overlay, from transparency in the middle to black on the edges, so it looks like a vignette effect on the photo or something.

Actually, let's do the opposite - black in the middle, transparent on edges. The gradient must be RADIAL

Can we make the gradient an ellipse rather than a circle? Like 80% of the screen width and 100 px height?
