### Prompt 1

Three improvements to the manage books screen:

1. When you are swiping on the item to trigger remove or edit, it would be creative. The removal indicator should not be not that the entire row goes red but we are displaying a red button on the right and then
2. For editing it is the same so a blue button on the left. No background change; the background can change to grayish or something.

Stop hook feedback:
📋 **Self-Review**

Please review these aspects of your changes:

**Implementation Completeness:**
• Are all the features actually working, or just pretending to work?

**Code Quality:**
• Is there duplicated logic that should be extracted?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Should you consolidate similar functions that now exist?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Are you following the same patterns used elsewhere in the codebase?

### Prompt 5

Take a close look at screenshots. We need much more border radius on both the action buttons and the grayish background of the item, a significant gap between the item text with background and the buttons, and a label (Edit/Delete) below the button (a text ouside the button)
