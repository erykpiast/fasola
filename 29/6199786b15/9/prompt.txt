Three improvements to the manage books screen:

1. When you are swiping on the item to trigger remove or edit, it would be creative. The removal indicator should not be not that the entire row goes red but we are displaying a red button on the right and then
2. For editing it is the same so a blue button on the left. No background change; the background can change to grayish or something.
3. There is a screenshot and then when the editing button on the left should stay in place rather than being dismissed.

The interaction in native Apple apps is like this: the user swipes, the background turns gray (around the text, with some border radius), the colorful button appears and stretches as far the user makes the gesture, but when they release, the button goes to the target size (fixed) and then the user needs to click it to confirm.

📋 **Self-Review**

Please review these aspects of your changes:

**Implementation Completeness:**
• Are all the features actually working, or just pretending to work?

**Code Quality:**
• Is there duplicated logic that should be extracted?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Should you consolidate similar functions that now exist?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Are you following the same patterns used elsewhere in the codebase?

💡 **Tip:** The code-review-expert subagent is available. Use it to review each self-review topic.
Use the Task tool with subagent_type: "code-review-expert"

Address any concerns before proceeding.

Take a close look at screenshots. We need much more border radius on both the action buttons and the grayish background of the item, a significant gap between the item text with background and the buttons, and a label (Edit/Delete) below the button (a text ouside the button)

**Implementation Completeness:**
• Does the implementation actually do what it claims, or just return hardcoded values?

**Code Quality:**
• Did you leave the code better than you found it?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Should you extract the new functionality into cleaner abstractions?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Are there related files that need the same changes?

The button still doesn't stretch

Please review these aspects of your changes:

**Implementation Completeness:**
• Did you create a mock implementation just to pass tests instead of real functionality?

**Code Quality:**
• Are you using different patterns than the existing code uses?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Should you extract the new functionality into cleaner abstractions?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Did you update all the places that depend on what you changed?
