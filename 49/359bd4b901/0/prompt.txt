Stop hook feedback:
📋 **Self-Review**

Please review these aspects of your changes:

**Implementation Completeness:**
• Did you create a mock implementation just to pass tests instead of real functionality?

**Code Quality:**
• Is there duplicated logic that should be extracted?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Did you just add code on top without integrating it properly?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Did you update all the places that depend on what you changed?

💡 **Tip:** The code-review-expert subagent is available. Use it to review each self-review topic.
Use the Task tool with subagent_type: "code-review-expert"
