**Code Quality:**
• Did you leave the code better than you found it?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Does the code structure still make sense after your additions?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Are there related files that need the same changes?

💡 **Tip:** The code-review-expert subagent is available. Use it to review each self-review topic.
