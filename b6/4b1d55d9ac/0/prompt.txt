Implement the following plan:

# Fix: Make processing transparent — show edit/remove buttons immediately

## Context

When a user imports a photo and opens it before background processing completes, `RecipeViewScreen` shows a redundant source selector + confirm button (the source was already set during import). The user is stuck with no back button and a confusing repeated workflow. Processing should be transparent: always show the normal recipe view (back, delete, edit) with edit disabled during processing, and display fun rotating status messages over the photo.

## Changes

### 1. `features/recipe-preview/components/RecipeViewScreen.tsx`

Remove the split `isProcessing` / `isReady` branches. Unify into a single view that always shows:
- `RecipeImageDisplay`
- `MetadataOverlay` (will show source, and title/tags once processing completes)
- `BackButton`
- `DeleteButton`
- `EditButton` with `disabled={!isReady}`
- When `isProcessing`: a centered `ProcessingIndicator` component (spinner + rotating message)

Remove: `SourceSelector`, `ConfirmButton`, `ConfirmButtonRef` imports and all related logic (`handleSourceChange`, `handleConfirm`, `confirmButtonRef`). These are no longer needed in this screen.

### 2. `lib/components/atoms/EditButton.tsx`

Add optional `disabled` prop. When true: set `opacity: 0.4` and `pointerEvents: 'none'` on the container style. No native module changes needed.

```tsx
export function EditButton({ onPress, disabled }: { onPress: () => void; disabled?: boolean }): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <LiquidGlassButton
      onPress={onPress}
      systemImage="pencil"
      style={[styles.button, disabled && styles.disabled]}
      accessibilityLabel="Edit"
    />
  );
}
// styles.disabled = { opacity: 0.4, pointerEvents: 'none' }
```

### 3. New: `features/recipe-preview/components/ProcessingIndicator.tsx`

Component showing `ActivityIndicator` + rotating `Text` message centered on screen. Uses a `useEffect` interval (2s) to cycle through messages.

Logic:
- Define a `FIRST_MESSAGE` key (always shown first)
- Define array of ~10 `ROTATING_MESSAGES` keys
- On mount, shuffle the rotating messages array (Fisher-Yates)
- Start with `FIRST_MESSAGE`, then cycle through shuffled array every 2s
- After exhausting shuffled array, loop back to start of shuffled array (skip first message on subsequent loops so the user discovers new ones)
- Fade transition between messages using `Animated.Text` opacity

Messages — culinary/recipe-book themed, lighthearted:

| Key | Text |
|-----|------|
| first | Squinting at the page... |
| m1 | Deciphering grandma's handwriting... |
| m2 | Reading between the lines... |
| m3 | Spotting the secret ingredient... |
| m4 | Counting pinches of salt... |
| m5 | Translating chef's shorthand... |
| m6 | Separating the wheat from the chaff... |
| m7 | Sifting through the flour of words... |
| m8 | Tasting the letters... |
| m9 | Letting the words simmer... |
| m10 | Fishing for the recipe name... |

### 4. `platform/i18n/translations/en.json`

Add `processing.messages` section with the keys above.

## Files summary

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `features/recipe-preview/components/RecipeViewScreen.tsx` | Edit — unify UI, add ProcessingIndicator |
| `lib/components/atoms/EditButton.tsx` | Edit — add disabled prop |
| `features/recipe-preview/components/ProcessingIndicator.tsx` | Create — spinner + rotating messages |
| `platform/i18n/translations/en.json` | Edit — add processing messages |

## Verification

1. Import a photo, set source, confirm
2. Tap the recipe immediately → should see photo + back + delete + edit (grayed out) + spinner with "Squinting at the page..."
3. Wait and observe messages rotating every 2s in random order
4. Re-open the screen → first message same, subsequent order differs
5. Wait for processing to complete → spinner disappears, edit button becomes active, metadata overlay updates with title/tags
6. Delete and back buttons work during processing

📋 **Self-Review**

Please review these aspects of your changes:

**Implementation Completeness:**
• Did you stub out functionality with placeholder messages instead of real logic?

**Code Quality:**
• Is every piece of code still serving a clear purpose?

**Integration & Refactoring:**
• Should you extract the new functionality into cleaner abstractions?

**Codebase Consistency:**
• Did you update all the places that depend on what you changed?
