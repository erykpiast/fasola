Please create Expo framework expert similar to @.claude/agents/react/react-expert.md and @.claude/agents/react-native/react-native-expert.md but focused on Expo-specific things such as multiplatform problems, built-in components and packages, build tools etc. Extract all Expo-specific bits from the React Native expert and delegate to the new Expo expert for relevant tasks. Search the web for relevant materials. You can find a list of many expo-related skills and instructions here: https://skills.sh/?q=expo
