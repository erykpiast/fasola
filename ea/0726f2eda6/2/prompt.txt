Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Create React Native Expert Agent

## Context

The project has a `.claude/agents/react-native/` directory with an empty `react-native-expert.md` placeholder. The React Expert agent at `.claude/agents/react/react-expert.md` serves as the structural template. Research across skills.sh (Vercel Labs 31.8K installs, Callstack 5.4K, wshobson, Expo), GitHub repositories, and official documentation informed the content.

## Action

Write a single file: `.claude/agents/react-native/react-native-expert.md`

The file mirrors the React Expert structure exactly (same sections, same formatting conventions) with React Native / Expo specific content:

### YAML Frontmatter
- `name: react-native-expert`
- `description`: Mobile-specific — RN crashes, slow lists, gestures, native bridge, Expo builds
- `tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit, MultiEdit, Write`
- `category: framework`, `color: blue`
- `bundle: [react-expert, react-performance-expert]`
- `displayName: React Native Expert`

### Sections (matching react-expert.md structure)
1. **Step 0: Recommend Specialist** — defers to react-expert (pure hooks), react-performance-expert, accessibility-expert, testing experts
2. **Environment Detection** — RN version, Expo SDK, New Architecture, Hermes, navigation lib, animation libs, state management
3. **8 Problem Playbooks** (each with Common Issues / Diagnosis / Prioritized Fixes / Validation / Resources):
   - List Performance (ScrollView to FlatList to FlashList)
   - Animations & Gestures (Reanimated worklets, Gesture Handler, UI thread)
   - Navigation (Expo Router, deep links, react-native-screens)
   - Native Module Integration (TurboModules, JSI, config plugins)
   - Bundle & Startup Performance (barrel exports, tree shaking, Hermes profiling)
   - Memory Management (effect cleanup, AbortController, image data in file system)
   - Platform-Specific Issues (iOS/Android, safe area, keyboard, shadows)
   - Image Handling (expo-image, caching, blurhash, contentFit)
4. **Runtime Considerations** — Hermes, New Architecture, React Compiler, Metro, platform threads
5. **Code Review Checklist** — 8 categories, ~40 checkboxes
6. **Safety Guidelines** — 6 items
7. **Anti-Patterns to Avoid** — 10 items

### Sources Informing Content
- Vercel Labs agent-skills (31.8K installs) — prioritized performance rules
- Callstack agent-skills — Ultimate Guide to RN Optimization based
- wshobson/agents — architecture and design patterns
- Expo/skills building-native-ui — Expo-specific conventions
- Official docs: reactnative.dev, docs.expo.dev, Software Mansion (Reanimated, Gesture Handler)

## Files Modified
- `.claude/agents/react-native/react-native-expert.md` — full rewrite (currently empty)

## Verification
1. Confirm file matches the structural pattern of `.claude/agents/react/react-expert.md` (same YAML fields, same section hierarchy)
2. Confirm `bundle` references (`react-expert`, `react-performance-expert`) point to existing agent files
3. Verify all bash diagnosis commands reference directories that exist in the project (`features/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `modules/`)
