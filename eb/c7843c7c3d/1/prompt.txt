Implement the following plan:

# Remove Color Correction from Saved Images

## Context

The image processing pipeline applies geometry correction (dewarping), lighting correction (white balance + illumination + CLAHE), and clarity enhancement (denoise + sharpen) to recipe photos. The fully processed image — including color correction — is saved as the display asset and used for thumbnail generation. This color correction sometimes produces visually strange results, making the saved photos look worse than the originals.

The fix: save only the geometry-corrected image for display/thumbnails, but keep the full pipeline (lighting + clarity) for the OCR input, where enhanced contrast and normalized lighting improve text recognition accuracy.

## Changes

### `lib/photo-processor/index.ts` — `processPhoto()`

After geometry correction completes (line 56), capture the geometry-only image in a separate variable before proceeding with lighting/clarity. At the end, return the geometry-only image as `processedUri` instead of the fully-processed one.

```
Current flow:
  imageDataUrl = geometry result
  imageDataUrl = lighting result    ← overwrites
  imageDataUrl = clarity result     ← overwrites
  return { processedUri: imageDataUrl, ocrResult }

New flow:
  imageDataUrl = geometry result
  geometryOnlyDataUrl = imageDataUrl   ← snapshot
  imageDataUrl = lighting result
  imageDataUrl = clarity result
  ocrImageDataUrl = grayscale || imageDataUrl
  [OCR runs on ocrImageDataUrl]
  return { processedUri: geometryOnlyDataUrl, ocrResult }
```

Concrete edits:
- Add `let geometryOnlyDataUrl = imageDataUrl` before the geometry block (covers the case where geometry is disabled — saves the original)
- After line 56 (`imageDataUrl = result.processedUri!`), reassign: `geometryOnlyDataUrl = imageDataUrl`
- At line 133 (`processedUri: imageDataUrl`), change to: `processedUri: geometryOnlyDataUrl`

No other files change. The lighting/clarity pipelines still run to produce the grayscale OCR input. `BackgroundProcessingContext`, thumbnails, storage, and display all use `result.processedUri` which will now be geometry-only.

## Verification

1. Import a recipe photo on device/simulator
2. Wait for background processing to complete
3. Verify the displayed image shows natural colors (geometry correction only, no artificial enhancement)
4. Verify OCR still extracts text (check recipe title/tags)
5. Verify thumbnail matches the geometry-corrected image
