We need to support the user in recognising image detail on imported photos, for instance whey they want to analyze what the recipe is really about - e.g. right after importing the photo when they want to verify OCR result or when they search for the given recipe and want to see the page number. 

That requires adding zoom capability to both the recipe preview screen and the recipe edit screen. It should work naturally with pinch and pan on mobile and scroll and drag on desktop web. 

Try not to reinvent the wheel but use existing Expo components or React Native libraries.
