We need new interaction points across the app to improve the UX:

## Back button

On the recipe preview screen, we want a ( < ) button in the left bottom corner that returns to the recipes list.

## Cancel button

On the recipe add button, we need an ( X ) button in the bottom right corner that cancels the import. Clicking the button should trigger a Cancel/Discard menu same as for the edition cancel. The click should also stop the auto-confirm animation of the confirm button - it should work exactly as for interaction with the select button.

## Remove button

On the preview screen, next to the edit button (on the left), we want a red trash bin icon that triggers a confirmation dialog (Cancel/Delete). When confirmed, it should remove the recipe from the DB.
