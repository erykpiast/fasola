We want to to introudce iCloud synchornisation for the app data: imported photos and the metadata storage. It should be transparent for the user - if they have iCloud turned on their device - the app just follows. No extra setting or log in needed.

The idea is that adding the recipes takes a lot of time, so if the data is lost, it may be very upsetting for the user, so we need to provide a backup. Also, when the user changes the device, it'd be great to allow them to see the same data on the new device as well.
